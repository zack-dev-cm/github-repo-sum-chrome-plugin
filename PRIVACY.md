# Privacy Policy

This extension operates entirely within your browser. It does not send any data to external servers other than the GitHub API when you request repository information.

## Data Stored Locally

- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: If you provide a token, it is saved using Chrome's `storage.local` so you don't need to re-enter it. The token is only used to authenticate requests to the GitHub API.
- **Repository Settings**: If you enable the *Save Settings* option, your selected directories, file extensions, and other preferences are stored in Chrome's `storage.local` under a key specific to each repository.

All information stored by the extension stays on your machine. You can remove it at any time by clearing the extension's data or deleting the token and saved settings through the popup interface.

## Data Usage

Stored data is used solely to make authenticated requests to the GitHub API and to restore your preferences. The extension does not collect analytics or share your data with any third party.
